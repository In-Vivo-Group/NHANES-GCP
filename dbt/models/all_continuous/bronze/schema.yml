    description: Albuminmeasurements are used in the diagnosis and treatment of diseases involving theliver andor kidneys. These measurements are frequently used to assessnutritional status, due to plasma levels of albumin being dependent on proteinintake. Increased microalbuminuria is a sign of renal disease and may bepredictive of nephropathy risk in patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes. Itis also associated with hypertension and cardiac disease.

  - name: audiometry_acoustic_reflex_examination
    description: The NHANES 2017-2018 audiometry examination component includes one main audiometry data file AUXJ and three middle ear testing data files. The acoustic reflex data file AUXARJ is one of quantitative measurements collected in the middle ear testing to evaluate the functional health of the middle ear system. The acoustic reflex is a protective, automatic reflex contraction of the eardrum in response to a sudden, high-intensity sound stimulus. Acoustic reflex testing results are useful in clarifying questionable tympanograms, verifying degree of hearing loss, and distinguishing between sensorineural hearing losses caused by damage to the cochlea versus the auditory nerve. The purpose of the present data file is to provide the underlying raw data curves for this set of acoustic reflexes, which will allow analysts to display actual acoustic reflex curves, make qualitative judgments regarding test adequacy and interpretation, and to perform quantitative analyses.

  - name: audiometry_wideband_reflectance_examination
    description: The NHANES 2017-2018 audiometry exam component includes one main audiometry data file AUXJ and three middle ear testing data files. This wideband reflectance data file AUXWBRJ is one of three middle ear testing to evaluate the functional health of the middle ear system. The wideband reflectance measures the transmission of sound through the eardrum across a range of frequencies while ear canal pressure remains constant. The propose of the present data file is to provide the underlying raw data curves for this set of wideband reflectance, which will allow analysts to display actual wideband absorbance curves, make qualitative judgments regarding test adequacy and interpretation, and to perform quantitative analyses.

As a result, data collection for the NHANES 2019-2020 cycle was not completed and the collected data are not nationally representative. Therefore, data collected from 2019 to March 2020 were combined with data from the NHANES 2017-2018 cycle to form a nationally representative sample of NHANES 2017-March 2020 pre-pandemic data. These data are available to the public. Please refer to the Analytic Notes section for more details on the use of the data.

    description: Chromium Cr is a naturally occurring element whosenutritional bioavailability and toxicity depends on its oxidation state.Trivalent chromium is considered an essential nutrient while hexavalentchromium is a human carcinogen and a commonly encountered occupational hazardfor humans Anderson 1989, ATSDR 2000. Cobalt Co is considered essentialbecause it is part of the B12 vitamin, which is important for the human brainand nervous center functioning and cell metabolism ATSDR 2000, Burtis et. al.,2012. While it is essential at certain lower levels, exposures to high levelsof cobalt can affect the heart andor lungs. Elevated exposures in animals havebeen shown to affect the liver and kidneys. The Agency for Toxic Substances andDisease Registry ATSDR lists cobalt as a possible carcinogen to animals dueto research performed by the International Agency for Research on Cancer wheredirect contact with cobalt occurred ATSRD 2000. It is uncertain whether ornot the effects seen in animals will also be seen in humans, and thisuncertainty adds additional concerns with a problem seen with failedmetal-on-metal MoM hip implants.

    description: The NHANES program suspended field operations in March 2020 due to the coronavirus disease 2019 COVID-19 pandemic. As a result, data collection for the NHANES 2019-2020 cycle was not completed and the collected data are not nationally representative. Therefore, data collected from 2019 to March 2020 were combined with data from the NHANES 2017-2018 cycle to form a nationally representative sample of NHANES 2017-March 2020 pre-pandemic data. These data are available to the public. Please refer to the Analytic Notes section for more details on the use of the data.

    description: The objective of the dietary interview component is to obtain detailed dietary intake information from NHANES participants. The dietary intake data are used to estimate the types and amounts of foods and beverages including all types of water consumed during the 24-hour period prior to the interview midnight to midnight, and to estimate intakes of energy, nutrients, and other food components from those foods and beverages. Following the dietary recall, participants are asked questions on salt use, whether the persons overall intake on the previous day was much more than usual, usual or much less than usual, and whether the respondent is on any type of special diet. Questions on frequency of fish and shellfish consumed during the past 30 days were asked of survey participants 1 year or older, with the use of proxies for young childrensee theMEC In-Person Dietary Interviewers Procedures Manual for more information on the proxy interview.

    description: The objective of the dietary interview component is to obtain detailed dietary intake information from NHANES participants. The dietary intake data are used to estimate the types and amounts of foods and beverages including all types of water consumed during the 24-hour period prior to the interview midnight to midnight, and to estimate intakes of energy, nutrients, and other food components from those foods and beverages. Following the dietary recall, participants are asked questions on salt use, whether the persons overall intake on the previous day was much more than usual, usual or much less than usual, and whether the participant is on any type of special diet. Questions on frequency of fish and shellfish consumed during the past 30 days are asked of participants 1 year or older, with the use of proxies for young children see the MEC In-Person Dietary Interviewers Procedures Manual for more information on the proxy interview.

    description: Ferritin is a protein that contains iron and is found in red blood cells. Ferritin levels are used primarily in evaluating the bodys iron metabolism and levels of iron storage or reserves, which can be too low or too high. Low storage of iron can lead to iron deficiency anemia. High levels of iron storage, also called iron overload, occurs when excess iron is accumulated in the body, primarily the liver.

    description: Flame retardants FRs areeither additive or reactive ingredients applied to household and consumerproducts to reduce the products flammability, and to meet state and federalfire safety standards and regulations. Until recently, a dominant class of FR additivesused for household products was polybrominated diphenyl ethers PBDEs, whichare persistent and can accumulate in the environment de Wit 2002 Law etal.2006, Stapleton et al. 2012. Flame retardant formulations containingchlorinated and non-chlorinated organophosphates and non-PBDE brominatedchemicals have entered consumers markets as PBDEs have been phased-out in manycountries van der Veen and de Boer 2012. Some of these compounds used inflame retardant formulations are triphenyl phosphate,tris1,3-dichloro-2-propyl phosphate, tris1-chloro-2-propyl phosphate,tris2-chloroethyl phosphate, tri-cresyl phosphates, tributyl phosphate,tribenzyl phosphate, and 2-ethylhexyl-2,3,4,5-tetrabromobenzoate. NHANESrecently developed a method to measure the metabolites of these compounds,which can be used as exposure biomarkers diphenyl phosphate,bis1,3-dichloro-2-propyl phosphate, bis1-chloro-2-propyl phosphate, bis-2-chloroethylphosphate, dibutyl phosphate, and 2,3,4,5-tetrabromobenzoic acid.

    description: C-reactive proteinCRP is an acute phase protein synthesized in the liver. It is involved in theactivation of complement, enhancement of phagocytosis, and detoxification ofsubstances released from damaged tissue. It is one of the most sensitive,though nonspecific, indicators of inflammation. CRP levels may rise within sixhours of an inflammatory stimulus. Measurement of CRP concentrations by thishighly sensitive method is performed primarily to ascertain the level ofcardiovascular disease risk in individuals who have no existing inflammatory conditions.Increases in CRP concentration are non-specific and should be used inconjunction with traditional clinical laboratory evaluation of acute coronarysyndromes.

    description: Insulin is theprimary hormone responsible for controlling glucose metabolism, and itssecretion is determined by plasma glucose concentration. The insulin moleculeis synthesized in the pancreas as pro-insulin and is later cleaved to formC-peptide and insulin. The principal function of insulin is to control theuptake and utilization of glucose in the peripheral tissues. Insulinconcentrations are severely reduced in insulin-dependent diabetes mellitusIDDM and some other conditions, while insulin concentrations are raised innon-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus NIDDM, obesity, and some endocrinedisorders.

    description: Iodine, anessential element for thyroid function, is necessary for normal growth,development, and functioning of the brain and body. Iodine-deficiency disorderIDD is a well-documented global health problem, affecting more than a billionpeople worldwide. Consequences of IDD include goiter, cretinism, intellectualimpairment, brain damage, mental retardation, stillbirth, congenitaldeformities, and increased perinatal mortality. Progress toward eliminatingIDDs has been substantial an estimated 70 of the worlds edible saltcurrently is iodized. Most excess iodine is excreted, and most people cantolerate fairly large amounts without experiencing problems. People with atendency toward autoimmune thyroid disease are less tolerant of excess iodine.If a person has previously been iodine-deficient, that person may be at riskfor iodine-induced hyperthyroidism. Excessive iodine intake by a mother canpose a reproductive risk. Since urinary iodine values directly reflect dietaryiodine intake, urinary iodine analysis is the recommended and most commonmethod for biochemically assessing the iodine status of a populationHollowell, et al., 1998.

    description: Mercury is a non-essentialelement that becomes toxic to various organ systems in the body especially thecentral nervous system, including the brain and the renal system, including thekidneys. Three main sources of mercury exposure in the U.S. are consumption offish, dental repairs, and occupational exposure. The general population may beexposed to three forms of mercury elemental, inorganic, or organic primarilymethyl mercury. The concentration of total mercury in urine is a measure of exposureprimarily to elemental and inorganic mercury, although some mercury in urinecomes from de-methylation of methyl mercury in blood Abe et al., 1995.

It is a continuous NHANES data collection specifically designed to estimate the prevalence of low-dose, over the counter preventive aspirin use in the United States. Cardiovascular disease CVD remains the leading cause of death in the United States. Low-dose aspirin might be considered for primary prevention of CVD among select adults aged 40-70 years who are at higher CVD risk but not at increased bleeding risk Arnett DK et al, 2019. Increasing aspirin use among individuals who are at high risk for CVD is one of the key Public Health objectives in the U.S. Frieden  Berwick, 2011.

    description: Soluble transferrinreceptor sTfR is a measure of iron deficiency and is particularly useful inpersons with inflammation, infection, or chronic disease, where ferritin levelsdo not correlate with true iron levels. Low storage of iron can lead toiron deficiency anemia. High levels of iron storage, also called iron overload,occurs when excess iron is accumulated in the body, primarily the liver.

    description: The Urine FlowRate or urine excretion rate is a measurement of the quantity of urineproduced in a specified period of time. Urine analyte concentrations fromsingle determinations spot urines can vary depending on level of hydration.Due to this variation, the urine flow rate, when used in conjunction withanalyte concentration measured on spot urine, can produce a better measure of analyteexcretion rate, especially in the context of exposure to environmentalchemicals. The urine excretion rate mgminis the product of the urine flow rate mLmin and the urine analyteconcentration mgmL.

Therefore, data collected from 2019 to March 2020were combined with data from surplus urine samples from the NHANES 2017-2018cycle to form a nationally representative sample of NHANES 2017-March 2020 pre-pandemicdata. These data are available to the public. Please refer to the AnalyticNotes section for more details on the use of the data.
