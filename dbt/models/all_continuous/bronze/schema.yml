    description: The NHANES program suspended field operations in March 2020 due to the coronavirus disease 2019 COVID-19 pandemic. As a result, data collection for the NHANES 2019-2020 cycle was not completed and the collected data are not nationally representative. Therefore, data collected from 2019 to March 2020 were combined with data from the NHANES 2017-2018 cycle to form a nationally representative sample of NHANES 2017-March 2020 pre-pandemic data. These data are available to the public. Please refer to the Analytic Notes section for more details on the use of the data.

It is a continuous NHANES data collection specifically designed to estimate the prevalence of low-dose, over the counter preventive aspirin use in the United States. Cardiovascular disease CVD remains the leading cause of death in the United States. Low-dose aspirin might be considered for primary prevention of CVD among select adults aged 40-70 years who are at higher CVD risk but not at increased bleeding risk Arnett DK et al, 2019. Increasing aspirin use among individuals who are at high risk for CVD is one of the key Public Health objectives in the U.S. Frieden  Berwick, 2011.

    description: Soluble transferrinreceptor sTfR is a measure of iron deficiency and is particularly useful inpersons with inflammation, infection, or chronic disease, where ferritin levelsdo not correlate with true iron levels. Low storage of iron can lead toiron deficiency anemia. High levels of iron storage, also called iron overload,occurs when excess iron is accumulated in the body, primarily the liver.

    description: The Urine FlowRate or urine excretion rate is a measurement of the quantity of urineproduced in a specified period of time. Urine analyte concentrations fromsingle determinations spot urines can vary depending on level of hydration.Due to this variation, the urine flow rate, when used in conjunction withanalyte concentration measured on spot urine, can produce a better measure of analyteexcretion rate, especially in the context of exposure to environmentalchemicals. The urine excretion rate mgminis the product of the urine flow rate mLmin and the urine analyteconcentration mgmL.
