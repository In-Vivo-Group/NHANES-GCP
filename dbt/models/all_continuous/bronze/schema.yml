  - name: acrylamide_glycidamide_laboratory
    description: Acrylamide, a toxic and potentially cancer-causing chemical, is formed in high amounts in many types of food preparedcooked at high temperatures. Acrylamide is formed during the cooking process, specifically when preparing french fries, potato chips and other fried products. Intake of acrylamide through the consumption of these foods can be high, thus exposing a large portion of the population to this chemical and putting them at risk of adverse health effects. Although acrylamide is known to cause adverse health effects, despite the existence of biomarkers to assess exposure to this chemical, limited data on the actual acrylamide exposure in the population exists. Filling this knowledge gap is especially important to properly assess the risks associated with the consumption of food containing high levels of acrylamide.

A nationally representative sample of household dust was collected to measure the amounts of common indoor allergens present which may be related to asthma and other allergic disease. A blood sample was also drawn at the NHANES examination site for IgE allergy antibody testing. The IgE studies, as a part of Allergy Component, measured both total IgE and also allergen-specific IgE responses to the same panel of allergens measured in the household dust collection. Also, IgE testing was performed for a panel of outdoor aeroallergens and for selected foods. IgE testing specific to these indoor, outdoor, and food allergens had not been previously performed in NHANES surveys.

  - name: atrazine_and_metabolites_laboratory
    description: Atrazine is a widely used chlorotriazine herbicide, active against broadleaf and grassy weeds, and applied both pre-and post-emergent to agricultural land for crops such as corn and sorghum. It is also used as a non-selective herbicide. In areas where atrazine is used, it may be detected pesticides in surface and ground waters. Atrazine does not bioaccumulate, but it degrades slowly in soils to dealkylated products, which may last for several months. Atrazine use has been progressively restricted because of concerns that drinking water sources may become contaminated. Human exposure may be evaluated by measuring urinary metabolites, but the dealkylated metabolites can result from metabolism of other chlorotriazine herbicides, including simazine, propazine, cyanazine. The dealkylated atrazine metabolites and hydroxyatrazine can also occur in the environment from breakdown of atrazine. Therefore, detection of the dealkylated metabolites in urine may reflect exposure to atrazine, another chlorotriazine herbicide, environmental breakdown products of one or more chlorotriazine herbicides, or any combination of these. Because atrazine is widely used in the U.S., measuring urinary atrazine and its metabolites is important to evaluate human exposure and potential for health effects.

Therefore, data collected from 2019 to March 2020 were combined with data from the NHANES 2017-2018 cycle to form a nationally representative sample of NHANES 2017-March 2020 pre-pandemic data. These data are available to the public. Please refer to the Analytic Notes section for more details on the use of the data.

  - name: audiometry_wideband_reflectance_examination
    description: The NHANES 2017-2018 audiometry exam component includes one main audiometry data file AUXJ and three middle ear testing data files. This wideband reflectance data file AUXWBRJ is one of three middle ear testing to evaluate the functional health of the middle ear system. The wideband reflectance measures the transmission of sound through the eardrum across a range of frequencies while ear canal pressure remains constant. The propose of the present data file is to provide the underlying raw data curves for this set of wideband reflectance, which will allow analysts to display actual wideband absorbance curves, make qualitative judgments regarding test adequacy and interpretation, and to perform quantitative analyses.

    description: Bacterial vaginosis BV and trichomoniasis are two of the most common vaginal conditions affecting women of childbearing age. In the United States, BV varies depending on the population studied, from 17 in some prenatal and family planning settings to 37 in STD clinics. The same is true for trichomoniasis, with between 3 and 48 of sexually active women diagnosed in various clinical settings. Recent studies have linked BV to adverse pregnancy and gynecologic outcomes, such as preterm labor and delivery, low birth weight, premature rupture of membranes, post-Cesarean endometritis, and post-abortal and post-hysterectomy infections. Also, trichomoniasis has been associated with preterm labor, preterm delivery, and low birth weight. More recently, both BV and trichomoniasis have been linked to an increased risk of HIV acquisition and transmission. However, no national surveillance system exists to measure the full burden of these two diseases, and no reliable national population estimate of BV or trichomoniasis exists. NHANES offers a unique opportunity to assess the prevalence of BV and Trichomonas vaginalis infections in the general population, to identify and confirm risk factors, and to monitor trends in prevalence as detection and treatment programs are established and expanded.

  - name: bioelectrical_impedance_analysis_examination
    description: Bioelectrical impedance analysis BIA measures the electrical impedance of body tissues and can be used to assess fluid volumes, total body water, and fat-free body mass. The NHANES bio-impedance spectroscopy BIS multi-frequency measurements were collected in the BIA examination, together with dual energy x-ray absorptiometry DXA scans, as part of the Body Composition component in the Mobile Examination Center MEC. A small alternating current was passed through surface electrodes placed on the right hand and foot and the impedance to the current flow was measured by different electrodes placed adjacent to the injection electrodes. The voltage drop between electrodes provided a measure of impedance, or opposition to the flow of the electric current.

As a result, data collection for the NHANES 2019-2020 cycle was not completed and the collected data are not nationally representative. Therefore, data collected from 2019 to March 2020 were combined with data from the NHANES 2017-2018 cycle to form a nationally representative sample of NHANES 2017-March 2020 pre-pandemic data. These data are available to the public. Please refer to the Analytic Notes section for more details on the use of the data.

    description: Blood pressure BP measurements have traditionally been obtained in NHANES using a mercury sphygmomanometer and a stethoscope with an auscultatory protocol, in which the examiner listens for sounds in the brachial artery to determine BP. Due to increased environmental concerns about the disposal of mercury-contaminated medical waste and the risk of spills from mercury sphygmomanometers, mercury devices have been phased out of clinical use. Alternative BP devices based on oscillometric protocols are increasingly used in clinical and epidemiological studies.

  - name: brominated_flame_retardants_bfrs_laboratory
    description: Polybrominated diphenyl ethers PBDEs are included in a larger group of chemicals known as brominated flame retardants and they are added to products such as foam padding, textiles, or plastics to retard combustion. PBDEs are not chemically bound to the flame-retarded material, so they can enter the environment from volatilization, leaching, or degradation of PBDE-containing products. PBDEs are generally persistent in the environment and have been measured in aquatic sediments, house dust, and aquatic and terrestrial animals, especially in fish where PBDEs are known to bioconcentrate. Hence humans may be exposed though the diet, including breast feeding, and by contact with flame retarded products and contaminated house dust. The rate of elimination of PDBEs from the human body depends on the specific PDBE, with elimination half-lives that can vary from a couple weeks to several months.

    description: Polybrominated diphenyl ethers PBDEs and 2,2,4,4,5,5-hexabromobiphenyl PBB-153 are included in a larger group of chemicals known as brominated flame retardants BFRs that are added to products such as foam padding, textiles, or plastics to retard combustion. BFRs are not chemically bound to the flame-retarded material, so they can enter the environment from volatilization, leaching, or degradation of BFR-containing products. PBDEs are generally persistent in the environment and have been measured in aquatic sediments, house dust, and aquatic and terrestrial animals. PBDEs have been shown to bioaccumulate in fish. Humans may be exposed though the diet, including breast feeding, and by contact with BFR-treated products and contaminated house dust. The elimination rate of these BFRs from the human body depends on the specific PBDE congener and can vary from a few weeks to several months. PBB-153 has an elimination half-life measured in decades.

    description: Chromium Cr is a naturally occurring element whosenutritional bioavailability and toxicity depends on its oxidation state.Trivalent chromium is considered an essential nutrient while hexavalentchromium is a human carcinogen and a commonly encountered occupational hazardfor humans Anderson 1989, ATSDR 2000. Cobalt Co is considered essentialbecause it is part of the B12 vitamin, which is important for the human brainand nervous center functioning and cell metabolism ATSDR 2000, Burtis et. al.,2012. While it is essential at certain lower levels, exposures to high levelsof cobalt can affect the heart andor lungs. Elevated exposures in animals havebeen shown to affect the liver and kidneys. The Agency for Toxic Substances andDisease Registry ATSDR lists cobalt as a possible carcinogen to animals dueto research performed by the International Agency for Research on Cancer wheredirect contact with cobalt occurred ATSRD 2000. It is uncertain whether ornot the effects seen in animals will also be seen in humans, and thisuncertainty adds additional concerns with a problem seen with failedmetal-on-metal MoM hip implants.

    description: One in three Americans has a skin condition serious enough to require medical attention. However, there are major gaps in knowledge about the frequency, impact, etiology and prevention of most skin diseases. Psoriasis affects the health related quality of life in ways similar to other major medical conditions. Studies of disability caused by psoriasis, such as arthritis, indicate that level of disability for those with the condition are greater than that of healthy controls. There is also an association between psoriasis and stress, as well as depression.

    description: The NHANES program suspended field operations in March 2020 due to the coronavirus disease 2019 COVID-19 pandemic. As a result, data collection for the NHANES 2019-2020 cycle was not completed and the collected data are not nationally representative. Therefore, data collected from 2019 to March 2020 were combined with data from the NHANES 2017-2018 cycle to form a nationally representative sample of NHANES 2017-March 2020 pre-pandemic data. These data are available to the public. Please refer to the Analytic Notes section for more details on the use of the data.

The dietary intake data are used to estimate the types and amounts of foods and beverages including all types of water consumed during the 24-hour period prior to the interview midnight to midnight, and to estimate intakes of energy, nutrients, and other food components from those foods and beverages. Following the dietary recall, participants are asked questions on salt use, whether the persons overall intake on the previous day was much more than usual, usual or much less than usual, and whether the respondent is on any type of special diet. Questions on frequency of fish and shellfish consumed during the past 30 days were asked of survey participants 1 year or older, with the use of proxies for young childrensee theMEC In-Person Dietary Interviewers Procedures Manual for more information on the proxy interview.

    description: The objective of the dietary interview component is to obtain detailed dietary intake information from NHANES participants. The dietary intake data are used to estimate the types and amounts of foods and beverages including all types of water consumed during the 24-hour period prior to the interview midnight to midnight, and to estimate intakes of energy, nutrients, and other food components from those foods and beverages. Following the dietary recall, participants are asked questions on salt use, whether the persons overall intake on the previous day was much more than usual, usual or much less than usual, and whether the participant is on any type of special diet. Questions on frequency of fish and shellfish consumed during the past 30 days are asked of participants 1 year or older, with the use of proxies for young children see the MEC In-Person Dietary Interviewers Procedures Manual for more information on the proxy interview.

    description: The objective of the dietary interview component is to obtain detailed dietary intake information from NHANES participants. The dietary intake data are used to estimate the types and amounts of foods and beverages including all types of water consumed during the 24-hour period prior to the interview midnight to midnight, and to estimate intakes of energy, nutrients, and other food components from those foods and beverages. Following the dietary recall, participants are asked questions on salt use, whether the persons overall intake on the previous day was much more than usual, usual or much less than usual, and whether the participant is on any type of special diet. Questions on frequency of fish and shellfish consumed during the past 30 days are asked of participants 1 year or older, with the use of proxies for young children see the MEC In-Person Dietary Interviewers Procedures Manual for more information on the proxy interview.

    description: The NHANES program suspended field operations in March 2020 due to the coronavirus disease 2019 COVID-19 pandemic. As a result, data collection for the NHANES 2019-2020 cycle was not completed and the collected data are not nationally representative. Therefore, data collected from 2019 to March 2020 were combined with data from the NHANES 2017-2018 cycle to form a nationally representative sample of NHANES 2017-March 2020 pre-pandemic data. These data are available to the public. Please refer to the Analytic Notes section for more details on the use of the data.

    description: The NHANES program suspended field operations in March 2020 due to the coronavirus disease 2019 COVID-19 pandemic. As a result, data collection for the NHANES 2019-2020 cycle was not completed and the collected data are not nationally representative. Therefore, data collected from 2019 to March 2020 were combined with data from the NHANES 2017-2018 cycle to form a nationally representative sample of NHANES 2017-March 2020 pre-pandemic data. These data are available to the public. Please refer to the Analytic Notes section for more details on the use of the data.

    description: The NHANES program suspended field operations in March 2020 due to the coronavirus disease 2019 COVID-19 pandemic. As a result, data collection for the NHANES 2019-2020 cycle was not completed and the collected data are not nationally representative. Therefore, data collected from 2019 to March 2020 were combined with data from the NHANES 2017-2018 cycle to form a nationally representative sample of NHANES 2017-March 2020 pre-pandemic data. These data are available to the public. Please refer to the Analytic Notes section for more details on the use of the data.

    description: Polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and dibenzofurans are two similar classes of chlorinated aromatic chemicals that are produced as contaminants or byproducts. They have no known commercial or natural use. Dioxins are produced primarily during the incineration or burning of waste the bleaching processes used in pulp and paper mills and the chemical syntheses of trichlorophenoxyacetic acid, hexachlorophene, vinyl chloride, trichlorophenol, and pentachlorophenol. Both the synthesis and heat-related degradation of polychlorinated biphenyls PCBs will produce dibenzofuran byproducts. The coplanar and mono-ortho-substituted PCBs are chlorinated aromatic hydrocarbon chemicals belonging to the general class of PCBs that were once synthesized for use as heat-exchanger, transformer, and hydraulic fluids, and also used as additives to paints, oils, window caulking, and floor tiles. Production of PCBs peaked in the early 1970s and was banned in the United States after 1979. Together with the polychlorinated dioxins and furans, these two special classes of PCBs are often referred to as dioxin-like chemicals because they act in the body through a similar mechanism.

Spirometry, including a 2nd test post-bronchodilator spirometry exam, was also conducted. Nitric Oxide NO is a chemical normally produced in the respiratory tract and can be detected in the exhaled breath. It is a noninvasive marker of airway inflammation. FENO has been shown to be higher in persons with asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease COPD and other respiratory conditions as compared to levels found in healthy persons. FENO measurements have also been used as a tool to monitor compliance with treatment with inhaled steroids in asthmatics.

Long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids are essentialfor normal development Hamosh, et al. 1998. The dietary content of saturated,monounsaturated, and polyunsaturated fatty acids influence the concentration ofcholesterol in low-density and high-density lipoproteins, and consequently thedevelopment of atherosclerosis OKeefe, et al. 1995. Regular consumption ofor supplementation with omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids can have beneficialeffects on long-term cardiovascular health due to anti-inflammatory and possiblyantiarrhythmic effects Kang, et al. 1996. The goal of this method is toobtain US reference ranges for most circulating fatty acids. Public healthrecommendations advise increasing or decreasing the intake of various classesof fatty acids saturated, monounsaturated, polyunsaturated but relativelylittle fatty acid biomarker data exist to support these recommendations andreference range data are scarce.

    description: Flame retardants FRs are either additive or reactive ingredients applied to household and consumer products to reduce the products flammability, and to meet state and federal fire safety standards and regulations. Until recently, the dominant class of FR additives used for household products was polybrominated diphenyl ethers PBDEs, which are persistent and can accumulate in the environment de Wit, 2002 Law 2006, Stapleton 2012. Flame retardant formulations containing chlorinated and non-chlorinated organophosphates and products such as Firemaster 550 FM550 have entered the consumers market worldwide as PBDEs have been phased-out in many countries van der Veen, 2012.  We recently developed a method to measure diphenyl phosphate, bis1,3-dichloro-2-propyl phosphate, bis1-chloro-2-propyl phosphate, bis2-chloroethyl phosphate, di-p-cresyl phosphate, di-o-cresyl phosphate, dibutyl phosphate, dibenzyl phosphate, and 2,3,4,5-tetrabromobenzoic acid .  These compounds are urinary metabolites of triphenyl phosphate, tris1,3-dichloro-2-propyl phosphate, tris1-chloro-2-propyl phosphate, tris2-chloroethyl phosphate, tri-cresyl phosphates, tributyl phosphate, tribenzyl phosphate, and 2-ethylhexyl-2,3,4,5-tetrabromobenzoate, respectively, and can be used as exposure biomarkers for these compounds.

Flame retardant formulationscontaining chlorinated and non-chlorinated organophosphates and non-PBDE brominatedchemicals have entered consumers markets as PBDEs have been phased-out in manycountries van der Veen and de Boer, 2012. Several organophosphate aryl estertechnical mixtures have been increasingly used in residential applications.These mixtures contain isomers of isopropylated and tert-butylatedtriarylphosphate esters, such as isopropylphenyldiphenyl phosphate and tert-butylphenyl diphenyl phosphate Phillips et.al., 2017. Additionally, human exposure to these mixtures has beendemonstrated to be widespread in several studies Hammel et. al., 2016Phillips et. al., 2018. We developed a method to quantify biomarkers ofexposure of several flame retardants, including 2-isopropylphenylphenylphosphate iPPPP and 4-tert-butylphenylphenyl phosphate tBPPP, twometabolites of isopropylphenyl diphenyl phosphates and tert-butylphenyldiphenyl phosphates, respectively.

    description: Fluoride is a natural element found atvarying concentrations in drinking water and soil. Water and water-basedbeverages are the primary source of dietary fluoride. Approximately 80 ofdietary fluoride comes from tap and bottled water Palmer, 2005 and EPA, 2010.Fluoride is voluntarily added to some drinking water systems as a public healthmeasure for reducing the incidence of cavities among the treated population.The decision to fluoridate a water supply is made by the state or localmunicipality and is not mandated by EPA or any other federal entity. TheCenters for Disease Control and Prevention CDC provides recommendations aboutthe optimal levels of fluoride in drinking water needed to prevent tooth decay.For community water systems that add fluoride to their water, the U.S. PublicHealth Service USPHS recommends a fluoride concentration of 0.7 mgL partsper million ppm to maintain tooth decay prevention benefits and reduce therisk of dental fluorosis Gooch, 2015. Kidneys representthe major route of fluoride removal from the body. Under normal conditions,roughly 60 of fluoride absorbed each day by healthy adults 1875 years isexcreted in urine.

    description: Dental fluorosis clinical assessment was included in the NHANES oral health examination to monitor fluorosis in the population for selected age groups.Fluoride exposure, from any source, during the period of tooth development is associated with increased risk of developing dental or enamel fluorosis. Dental fluorosis is characterized by an increasing porosity or hypomineralization of the tooth enamel that leads to visual changes of the enamel that appear once a tooth erupts Dean, 1934 Fejerskov et al., 1990. The severity of dental fluorosis depends on the dose and duration of fluoride ingestion during tooth development Dean, 1942 Fejerskov et al., 1990.

    description: Measurement of Unmetabolized Folic Acid in Serum. Folic acid and 5MeTHF concentrations were determined using the affinityHPLC method with electrochemical coulometric detection method Which was developed by us at the USDA Human Nutrition Research Center at Tufts University Bagleyet al.,1997 Kalmbach et al., 2008 with the following modifications to increase throughput and precision.Serum samples 0.2 mL were diluted with 1.2 mL of 50mM potassium tetraborate in 1 sodium ascorbate and vortexed. Twenty picomoles of ethyltetrahydrofolate eTHF was added as an internal standard. The mixture was boiled for 30 minutes and then cooled on ice and kept covered overnight at 4 C. The mixture was centrifuged for 20 minutes at 4 C at 36,000xg and filtered. An aliquot 0.9ml of the supernatant fraction was injected onto the affinityHPLC system. The revised affinityHPLC system consisted of two affinity columns, containing immobilized folate binding protein FBP, that were connected via a 10 port, two position switching valve to an analytical column Betasil Phenyl 250 x 4.6 mm Keystone Scientific. This allows one affinity column to be loaded with the sample and subsequently washed with a pH 7.0 phosphate buffer, while the second is eluted into the analytical column with an acetonitrile gradient at acid pH and into the electrochemical detector. At the end of the run, a signal is sent to switch the direction of the mobile phases to allow the elution of the loaded column for folate analysis and simultaneous loading of the second column with the new sample. Folate activity was determined by using an ESA Four Channel Coularray Detector set at 0, 300, 500 and 600mV. Quantification and identification of individual folates was done by comparison to external and internal folate standards of known concentration. Limit of detection was 0.18 pmolml for 5-methyltetrahydrofolate and folic acid. Recovery was 92.2 5-methyltetrahydrofolate and 98.9 folic acid. CVs for samples ran alone or spiked with 5, 10, and 20 pmol of folate were 5.2-8.6 for 5-methyltetrahydrofolate within day and 3.2-6.3 between days and for folic acid 5.3-6.4 within day and 3.5-7.3 between days. Run time for the HPLC was reduced to 30 min per sample 40-45 samples analyzed per 24 hours.

In 2015, the International Agency for Research on Cancer determined that glyphosate is a probable human carcinogen IARC, 2015. However, the European Food Safety Authority and the Joint Food and Agriculture Organization FAOWorld Health Organization WHO Meeting on Pesticide Residues EFSA 2015, FAOWHO 2015 determined that glyphosate is unlikely to be a carcinogen. The US EPA concluded that available data and weight-of-evidence clearly do not support the descriptors carcinogenic to humans, likely to be carcinogenic to humans, or inadequate information to assess carcinogenic potential US EPA 2017a. Controversy and concern that the rising use of glyphosate may have adverse human-health effects exist Myers et. al., 2016. Yet, the extent of human exposure to glyphosate in the U.S. population is largely unknown. Data to better understand exposure to glyphosate are needed to increase our knowledge of its potential effects on health.

The U.S. EPA concluded that available data and weight-of-evidence clearly do not support the descriptors carcinogenic to humans, likely to be carcinogenic to humans, or inadequate information to assess carcinogenic potential U.S. EPA, 2017a. Controversy and concern that the rising use of glyphosate may have adverse human-health effects exist Myers et. al., 2016. Yet, the extent of human exposure to glyphosate in the U.S. population is largely unknown. Data to better understand exposure to glyphosate are needed to increase our knowledge of its potential effects on health.

As aresult, data collection for the NHANES 2019-2020 cycle was not completed andthe collected data are not nationally representative. Therefore,data collected from 2019 to March 2020 were combined with data from the NHANES2017-2018 cycle to form a nationally representative sample of NHANES 2017-March2020 pre-pandemic data.

    description: Prior to 2013, specimens with a reactive anti-HCV screening test result were tested with a confirmatory recombinant immunoblot assay RIBA Chiron RIBA HCV 3.0 Strip SIA to confirm the presence of anti-HCV. Results for confirmed anti-HCV LBDHCV were reported as positive if the RIBA was positive, as indeterminate if the RIBA was indeterminate, and as negative if the RIBA was negative or if the anti-HCV screening test result was negative. RIBA positive and indeterminate specimens were further tested for HVC RNA, and, if RNA positive, for HCV genotype. As of late 2012, Chiron is no longer producing RIBA kits and thus no confirmatory test for anti-HCV was available for the 2013-2014 NHANES cycle. Because only 67.7 323 of 477 of NHANES specimens with a reactive anti-HCV screening test result during NHANES 2007-2012 were found to be RIBA positive, reporting all specimens with a reactive anti-HCV screening test result as anti-HCV positive would result in an apparent increase in prevalence of ever having HCV infection due merely to the reporting of screening anti-HCV false-positives as antibody positive. Thus, for NHANES to continue to track trends in prevalence of ever having HCV infection via anti-HCV after the 2011-2012 cycle, it is necessary to employ a new HCV testing algorithm, which can produce a prevalence for ever having HCV infection closer to that obtained using RIBA confirmation than would be obtained if all specimens with a reactive anti-HCV screening test result were reported as antibody positive. Data from serum surplus testing with a second anti-HCV screening assay sometimes referred to as reflex testing, performed to evaluate potential new HCV testing algorithms for NHANES specimens collected after the 2011-2012 cycle, are reported in this file, along with initial anti-HCV screening test and RIBA results.

New immunization strategies have been developed to eliminate the spread of hepatitis B virus HBV and hepatitis A virus HAV in the United States. Recommendations have also been developed for the prevention and control of hepatitis C virus HCV infection. Infection with hepatitis E virus HEV has been responsible for large water-borne epidemics of acute disease in developing countries and for acute sporadic disease in industrialized developed countries. In immunocompromised individuals, infection with HEV may also cause chronic infection, which may progress to fibrosis and cirrhosis.

It is involved in theactivation of complement, enhancement of phagocytosis, and detoxification ofsubstances released from damaged tissue. It is one of the most sensitive,though nonspecific, indicators of inflammation. CRP levels may rise within sixhours of an inflammatory stimulus. Measurement of CRP concentrations by thishighly sensitive method is performed primarily to ascertain the level ofcardiovascular disease risk in individuals who have no existing inflammatory conditions.Increases in CRP concentration are non-specific and should be used inconjunction with traditional clinical laboratory evaluation of acute coronarysyndromes.

Oral HPV infection is newlyappreciated as a strong risk factor for a distinct type of oropharyngealsquamous cell carcinoma that is rising in incidences in the United States. Ithas been estimated that oral HPV16 infection confers an approximate 15-foldincrease in risk for oropharyngeal cancer. Despite these strong risks, littleis known about the epidemiology of oral HPV infection. No population-basedsurveys of oral HPV infection, type distribution and determinants, have beenperformed in any population worldwide.

    description: Insulin is theprimary hormone responsible for controlling glucose metabolism, and itssecretion is determined by plasma glucose concentration. The insulin moleculeis synthesized in the pancreas as pro-insulin and is later cleaved to formC-peptide and insulin. The principal function of insulin is to control theuptake and utilization of glucose in the peripheral tissues. Insulinconcentrations are severely reduced in insulin-dependent diabetes mellitusIDDM and some other conditions, while insulin concentrations are raised innon-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus NIDDM, obesity, and some endocrinedisorders.

    description: Iodine, anessential element for thyroid function, is necessary for normal growth,development, and functioning of the brain and body. Iodine-deficiency disorderIDD is a well-documented global health problem, affecting more than a billionpeople worldwide. Consequences of IDD include goiter, cretinism, intellectualimpairment, brain damage, mental retardation, stillbirth, congenitaldeformities, and increased perinatal mortality. Progress toward eliminatingIDDs has been substantial an estimated 70 of the worlds edible saltcurrently is iodized. Most excess iodine is excreted, and most people cantolerate fairly large amounts without experiencing problems. People with atendency toward autoimmune thyroid disease are less tolerant of excess iodine.If a person has previously been iodine-deficient, that person may be at riskfor iodine-induced hyperthyroidism. Excessive iodine intake by a mother canpose a reproductive risk. Since urinary iodine values directly reflect dietaryiodine intake, urinary iodine analysis is the recommended and most commonmethod for biochemically assessing the iodine status of a populationHollowell, et al., 1998.

    description: Susceptibility to measles, mumps, rubella, and varicella MMRV for the purpose of monitoring the susceptibility of the U.S. population to each of these highly contagious, infectious diseases. Serological testing for antibodies for MMRV among NHANES participants has been a primary means for determining the impact of the vaccination program in the U.S. and would serve to document progress toward achieving the Healthy People 2010 goals related to all four of these diseases. In addition, documenting trends in immunity is necessary to estimate duration of protection in the US population. Documentation of waning immunity in a population with high vaccination coverage and low probability of boosting due to exposure to wild virus will have implications on future vaccination policy in the US.

Also, see the documentation for the primary exam data for Laboratory 19. Measles Measles is a highly infectious disease targeted for elimination in the United States by the year 1996. The elimination strategy called for vaccination of all susceptible persons at age 12-15 months and at 4-11 years. NHANES will assess age-specific population immunity, taking into account vaccinees who never develop antibodies, persons who may lose immunity over time, and persons who are immune from natural disease. The U.S. measles elimination goal for 1996 came at a time when measles elimination was being considered as an achievable goal worldwide by the World Health Organization. If success can be demonstrated in the U.S. as well as other countries in the hemisphere, worldwide efforts to eliminate measles will be encouraged. The benefit from a study of measles seroprevalence will be to document age-specific immunity that is found following measles elimination efforts and to help judge the levels of immunity that are needed to eliminate measles. Rubella Congenital rubella syndrome CRS is the term used to describe the serious birth defects that occur among infants born to women infected with rubella while pregnant. A single rubella vaccination, usually given as measles-mumps-rubella MMR vaccine, is thought to confer lifelong immunity. Widespread use of the vaccine has resulted in near elimination of CRS in the United States. In recent years, an increasing proportion of rubella cases have been reported among adults, and outbreaks have occurred among persons of Hispanic ethnicity. Population-based rubella seroprevalence studies will provide valuable information about specific groups that lack rubella immunity and therefore could be targeted for immunization. Therefore serologic testing of NHANES participants will be conducted to document the level of immunity to rubella by race and ethnicity and allow comparison data from NHANES III. VaricellaIn 1995, a vaccine for prevention of varicella chicken pox was licensed for use in persons 1 year of age and older. Wide use of the vaccine may change the epidemiology of the disease with a shift in incidence to older persons who are at higher risk than are younger persons for more severe disease and complications. Older persons may have severe complications such as encephalitis andor death if they develop varicella. Additionally, pregnant women can pass on varicella if they develop it in the last weeks of gestation with severe life-threatening consequences to the newborn. NHANES provides a unique opportunity to assess changes in the seroprevalence of immunity to varicella after introduction of the vaccine. Demographic data on immune and susceptible persons will help target vaccination programs toward groups at risk for disease.

    description: An NHANES version of three modules from the automated version of the World Health Organization Composite International Diagnostic Interview, Version 2.1 CIDI-Auto 2.1 was administered during the face-to-face portion of the Mobile Examination Center MEC interview. The CIDI is a comprehensive, fully standardized interview that is used to assess mental disorders and provide diagnoses according to definitions and criteria of the tenth revision of the International Classification of Diseases ICD-10, World Health Organization 1992, 1993 and the fourth edition of the American Psychiatric Associations Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders DSM-IV, 1994. The CIDI is especially suitable for large epidemiological studies because it can be administered by lay interviewers, does not require outside informants or medical records, and does not assume the presence of a current disorder. It is used in both clinical and research settings.

    description: An NHANES version of three modules from the automated version of the World Health Organization Composite International Diagnostic Interview, Version 2.1 CIDI-Auto 2.1 was administered during the face-to-face portion of the Mobile Examination Center MEC interview. The CIDI is a comprehensive, fully standardized interview that is used to assess mental disorders and provide diagnoses according to definitions and criteria of the tenth revision of the International Classification of Diseases ICD-10, World Health Organization 1992, 1993 and the fourth edition of the American Psychiatric Associations Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders DSM-IV, 1994. The CIDI is especially suitable for large epidemiological studies because it can be administered by lay interviewers, does not require outside informants or medical records, and does not assume the presence of a current disorder. It is used in both clinical and research settings.

    description: An NHANES version of three modules from the automated version of the World Health Organization Composite International Diagnostic Interview, Version 2.1 CIDI-Auto 2.1 was administered during the face-to-face portion of the Mobile Examination Center MEC interview. The CIDI is a comprehensive, fully standardized interview that is used to assess mental disorders and provide diagnoses according to definitions and criteria of the tenth revision of the International Classification of Diseases ICD-10, World Health Organization 1992, 1993 and the fourth edition of the American Psychiatric Associations Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders DSM-IV, 1994. The CIDI is especially suitable for large epidemiological studies because it can be administered by lay interviewers, does not require outside informants or medical records, and does not assume the presence of a current disorder. It is used in both clinical and research settings.

    description: The objective of the NHANES Hair Mercury component is to document total mercury levels in human hair for a representative sample of U.S. children and women of reproductive age. Previous research has established that the mercury concentration in human scalp hair largelyrepresents dietary methyl mercury exposure, methyl mercury being a known human neurotoxin.

    description: Mercury is a non-essentialelement that becomes toxic to various organ systems in the body especially thecentral nervous system, including the brain and the renal system, including thekidneys. Three main sources of mercury exposure in the U.S. are consumption offish, dental repairs, and occupational exposure. The general population may beexposed to three forms of mercury elemental, inorganic, or organic primarilymethyl mercury. The concentration of total mercury in urine is a measure of exposureprimarily to elemental and inorganic mercury, although some mercury in urinecomes from de-methylation of methyl mercury in blood Abe et al., 1995.

    description: Staphylococcus aureus is one of the most common causes of skin and soft tissue infection in both the health care and community settings. Antimicrobial resistance in S. aureus has increased dramatically, particularly in the hospital, where the rapid emergence of methicillin-resistant S. aureus MRSA and the appearance of S. aureus isolates with resistance to vancomycin have led to concern that this organism may become untreatable with currently available antimicrobials. Previously limited to hospitals, MRSA infections have been increasingly reported in the community. However, no prospective, population-based prevalence study has been done to measure the prevalence of MRSA in the community, and no national surveillance exists to provide a reliable national population estimate.

The use of DEHP in the U.S. market appears to be decreasing, at least in part because of legislative efforts, while the use of di-isononyl phthalate DiNP, one of the replacements of DEHP, and other phthalate alternatives, may be rising Calafat et al. 2011Zota et al. 2014.  Di-2-ethylhexyl terephthalate DEHTP, a structural isomer of DEHP and one of such alternatives, has been used as a plasticizer for polymers contained in consumer products Beeler 1976.  To better understand exposure to phthalates alternatives, we quantified mono-2-ethyl-5-hydroxyhexyl terephthalate MEHHTP, mono-2-ethyl-5-carboxypentyl terephthalate MECPTP, two metabolites of DEHTP, and monooxoisononyl phthalate MONP, an additional metabolite of DiNP, in one third subsample of participants 3 years of age from NHANES 2015-2016.

    description: Polychlorinated biphenyls PCBs are a class of chlorinated aromatic hydrocarbon chemicals that once were used as heat-exchanger, transformer, and hydraulic fluids, and as additives to paints, oils, joint caulking, and floor tiles. The different types of PCBs are known as congeners, which are compounds that are distinguished by the number of chlorine atoms and their location on the biphenyl structure. Peak production occurred in the early 1970s, and production was banned in the U.S. after 1979. More than 1.5 million pounds of PCBs were manufactured in the U.S. prior to 1977. Concern about these chemicals continues because of their persistence in the environment and accumulation in wildlife and the animal food chain. PCBs enter the food chain by various routes, including migration into food from external sources, contamination of animal feeds, and accumulation in the fatty tissues of animals. PCBs are found in higher concentrations in fatty foods, e.g., dairy products and fish, and food is the main source of exposure for the general population. PCBs can be transferred from mother to infant via breast milk. Exposure to these chemicals nearly always occurs as mixtures rather than individual PCB congeners.

    description: Polychlorinatedbiphenyls PCBs are a class of chlorinated aromatic hydrocarbon chemicals thatonce were used as heat-exchangers, transformers, and hydraulic fluids, and asadditives to paints, oils, joint caulking, and floor tiles. The different typesof PCBs are known as congeners, which are compounds that are distinguished bythe number of chlorine atoms and their location on the biphenyl structure. Peakproduction occurred in the early 1970s, and production was banned in the U.S.after 1979. More than 1.5 million pounds of PCBs were manufactured in the U.S.prior to 1977. Concern about these chemicals continues because of theirpersistence in the environment and accumulation in wildlife and the animal foodchain. PCBs enter the food chain by various routes, including migration intofood from external sources, contamination of animal feeds, and accumulation inthe fatty tissues of animals. PCBs are foundin higher concentrations infatty foods, e.g., dairy products and fish, and food is the main source ofexposure for the general population. PCBs can be transferred from mother toinfant via breast milk. Exposure to these chemicals nearly always occurs asmixtures rather than individual PCB congeners.

    description: Polychlorinated biphenyls PCBs are a class of chlorinated aromatic hydrocarbon chemicals that once were used as heat-exchanger, transformer, and hydraulic fluids, and as additives to paints, oils, joint caulking, and floor tiles. The different types of PCBs are known as congeners, which are compounds that are distinguished by the number of chlorine atoms and their location on the biphenyl structure. Peak production occurred in the early 1970s, and production was banned in the U.S. after 1979. More than 1.5 million pounds of PCBs were manufactured in the U.S. prior to 1977. Concern about these chemicals continues because of their persistence in the environment and accumulation in wildlife and the animal food chain. PCBs enter the food chain by various routes, including migration into food from external sources, contamination of animal feeds, and accumulation in the fatty tissues of animals. PCBs are found a higher concentrations in fatty foods, e.g., dairy products and fish, and food is the main source of exposure for the general population. PCBs can be transferred from mother to infant via breast milk. Exposure to these chemicals nearly always occurs as mixtures rather than individual PCB congeners.

A quantitative enzyme immunoassay that uses norovirus virus-like particles VLPs to detect anti-norovirus IgG was used. Samples were diluted 150 for analysis. The results are reported in optical density OD and ng IgGml. Samples with OD 3 i.e. above the measurable range of the assay, strongly positive are reported as 3.50. Concentrations greater than the highest standard 2000 ng IgGml are reported as 100,000 ng IgGml, the upper limit of detection. Samples with OD less than the plate blank are coded 0.00. Missing observations represent samples that could not be tested due to insufficient volume or technical errors.

    description: NHANES is critical for monitoring oral health status, risk indicators for disease, and access to preventive and treatment services. This component will address public health significance in areas of surveillance, prevention, treatment, dental care utilization, health policy, evaluation of Federal health programs, standardization of new methods, and oral health disparities. The purpose of this component is to assess the prevalence of oral conditions and diseases, such as edentulism, denture use, dental sealants, and dental caries. A concurrent set of questions administered during the household interview assesses issues related to oral health quality of life.

  - name: organophosphate_insecticides_diakyl_phosphate_metabolites_urine_laboratory
    description: Organophosphorus insecticides, which are active against a broad spectrum of insects, have accounted for a large share of all insecticides used in the United States. Although organophosphorus insecticides are still used for insect control on many food crops, most residential uses have been phased out in the United States as a result of implementation of the Food Quality Protection Act of 1996. Pesticide residues and their metabolites in human tissues and fluids can be indicative of pesticide exposure and the total body burden of these pesticides. About 75 of registered organophosphorus insecticides are metabolized in the body to measurable dialkyl phosphate DAP metabolites. Dialkyl phosphates may also occur in the environment as a result of degradation of organophosphorus insecticides, and therefore, the presence in a persons urine may reflect exposure to the metabolite itself.

It can indicate if the urine is overly diluted or concentrated due to hydration status or impaired renal function. The concentration of urine analytes such as environmental chemicals can fluctuate in spot single determination urine specimens depending on whether the urine is too diluted or concentrated. To compensate, the urine analyte concentration is divided by the Urine Osmolality to standardize the spot urine analyte concentration. Urine Osmolality will be measured by freezing point determination in the Mobile Exam Center.

    description: Perchlorate has been used as an oxidant in solid fuel propellants for rockets and missiles since the 1950s. Lesser amounts of perchlorate are used in matches and fireworks. Perchlorate can also form naturally in the environment and can accumulate in nitrate-rich mineral deposits mined for use in fertilizers. Drinking water, milk, and certain plants with high water content e.g., lettuce can be the main sources of perchlorate intake for humans. Perchlorate has been used medically to treat hyperthyroidism. Its inhibitory effect on thyroid hormone production has led to concerns that exposure even to low levels of perchlorate in the environment might affect vulnerable groups, such as pregnant women with inadequate iodine intake and infants for whom thyroid hormone levels must be maintained adequately for normal brain development. Perchlorate taken into the body is rapidly eliminated in the urine, within a matter of hours. Measurement of urinary perchlorate is useful to assess recent human exposure.

    description: Exposure data to perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances PFAS among the US general population 12 years of age and older have been included in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey NHANES since 1999-2000 CDC 2015. However, general population data among children 3-11 years of age are limited to those obtained from using pooled sera collected in NHANES 2001-2002 Kato et al. 2009.Exposure data in children may impact health later in life and, therefore, are of public health significance. However, data on general exposure to PFAS among American children younger than 12 years do not exist in NHANES using individual samples. To fill this exposure data gap, we measured fourteen PFAS in one third subset of participants 3-11 years of age using surplus sera collected for the measurement of cotinine as part of NHANES 2013-2014.

    description: Update to terminology The now widely accepted term for perfluorinated chemicals used here is perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances PFAS. The primary objective of this study was to characterize serum concentrations of selected perfluorinated chemicals PFCs, including perfluoroctanoate PFOA and perfluorooctanesulfonate PFOS, in a representative random 13 subset of the non-occupationally exposed US population from NHANES 1999-2000, so that we could obtain national population levels for these compounds over this two-year period.

Propylenethiourea PTU is the metabolite and environmental breakdown product of propineb. These fungicides can be applied to fruits, vegetables, field crops, and ornamental plants, but they are not registered for residential use. ETU and related chemicals have numerous industrial uses and have also been used as scavengers in waste water treatment. ETU and PTU do not bioaccumulate and are rapidly eliminated in urine following human exposure.

    description: Organochlorine pesticides, an older class of pesticides, are effective against a variety of insects. These chemicals were introduced in the 1940s, and many of their uses have been cancelled or restricted by the U.S. EPA because of their environmental persistence and potential adverse effects on wildlife and human health. Many organochlorines are no longer used widely in the U.S., but other countries continue to use them. Hexachlorobenzene has been used primarily as a fungicide or biocide.

    description: Dibutyl phthalates, including di-n-butyl phthalate DBP and di-isobutyl phthalate DiBP, are used as plasticizers for polymers contained in consumer products, such as adhesives and cosmetics Hubinger 2010Hubinger and Havery 2006.  Since 2001, at CDC, we have measured mono-n-butyl phthalate MBP and mono-isobutyl phthalate MiBP to assess exposure to DBP and DiBP, respectively.  We recently modified the original analytical method used at CDC for measuring phthalate metabolites, so we could include two oxidative metabolites of DBP and DiBP, mono-3-hydroxy-n-butyl phthalate MHBP and mono-2-hydroxy-iso-butyl phthalate MHiBP, from NHANES 2013-2014.

    description: Phthalate acid esters phthalates have been used extensively as plasticizers in a wide range of applications such as childrens toys, food packaging, personal care products, and medical supplies. Because some of these compounds have been shown to bind to estrogen receptors and have been associated with estrogenic effects in laboratory animals, increasing concerns have been expressed about phthalate usage in food packaging materials, personal care products, and childrens toys. Measurement of urinary phthalate metabolites in humans is useful to evaluate recent exposure and potential human health effects from these chemicals.

    description: Phytoestrogens are plant-derived polyphenolic compounds, such as isoflavones and lignans that are structurally similar to endogenous estrogens Cornwell, et al. 2004. Phytoestrogens are capable of estrogen-receptor bindingCornwell et al., 2004 and may also influence other biologic pathways. The consumption of diets high in phytoestrogen-rich foods has been associated with lower rates of hormone-dependent cancers Peeters et al., 2003Adlercreutz et al., 2002 Davis et al., 1999, improved bone health Ma et al., 2007 Coxam et al., 2003 and other healthy outcomes. Biomeasures of phytoestrogens are necessary to establish reference ranges for these compounds and to evaluate their potential effects on human health.

    description: Polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins PCDDs, dibenzofurans PCDFs, and dioxin-like polychlorinated biphenyls PCBs coplanar and several mono-ortho-substituted PCBs are similar classes of chlorinated aromatic chemicals that are produced as contaminants or byproducts. They have no known commercial or natural use. Dioxins are produced primarily during the incineration or burning of waste the bleaching processes used in pulp and paper mills and the chemical syntheses of trichlorophenoxyacetic acid, hexachlorophene, vinyl chloride, trichlorophenol, and pentachlorophenol. Both the synthesis and heat-related degradation of PCBs will produce PCDF by-products. PCBs are chlorinated aromatic hydrocarbon chemicals that were once synthesized for use as heat-exchanger, transformer, and hydraulic fluids, and also used as additives to paints, oils, window caulking, and floor tiles.

    description: Organic fluorochemicals are used in multiple commercial applications including surfactants, lubricants, paints, polishes, food packaging and fire-retarding foams. Several of these polyfluorochemicals PFCs are ubiquitous contaminants found both in humans and animals worldwide. Perfluorooctane sulfonate PFOS has been used in a wide variety of industrial and consumer products including protective coatings for carpets and apparel, paper coatings, insecticide formulations, and surfactants. In May 2000, the 3M Company, the sole manufacturer of PFOS in the United States and the principal manufacturer worldwide, announced that it was discontinuing the production of perfluorooctanyl fluoride-based chemistries, including PFOS. Perfluorooctanoic acid PFOA is used primarily to produce salts which are used in the production of fluoroelastomers and fluoropolymers, such as polytetrafluoroethylene PTFE and polyvinylidine fluoride PVDF. PTFE has numerous uses in many industrial and consumer products, including coatings on textiles and carpet uses in the automotive, mechanical, aerospace, chemical, electrical, medical, and buildingconstruction industries personal care products and non-stick coatings on cookware. PVDF is used primarily in electricalelectronics, buildingconstruction, and chemical processing industrial sectors.

It is a continuous NHANES data collection specifically designed to estimate the prevalence of low-dose, over the counter preventive aspirin use in the United States. Cardiovascular disease CVD remains the leading cause of death in the United States. Low-dose aspirin might be considered for primary prevention of CVD among select adults aged 40-70 years who are at higher CVD risk but not at increased bleeding risk Arnett DK et al, 2019. Increasing aspirin use among individuals who are at high risk for CVD is one of the key Public Health objectives in the U.S. Frieden  Berwick, 2011.

    description: Pyrethroid pesticides are synthetic analogues of pyrethrins, used to control a range of insects in residential, commercial and agricultural settings, and they may be applied on animals to control insect infestation. Pyrethroid insecticides are among the most common active ingredients in commercially available insect sprays and are also used as structural termiticides. Permethrin is used in skin lotions and shampoos as a medical treatment for lice and scabies. Pyrethroid insecticides do not persist in the environment because they are rapidly degraded within days to months. Human metabolism of pyrethroids occurs rapidly, and metabolites are eliminated in urine and bile over several days. Two of the urinary metabolites measured are unique to specific pyrethroids 4-fluoro-3-phenoxyacetic acid from cyfluthrin and cis-3-2,2-dibromovinyl-2,2-dimethylcyclopropane carboxylic acid from deltamethrin. The other urinary metabolites can result from exposure to any of several pyrethroid insecticides. Because pyrethroid insecticides are widely used in the U.S. population, measuring urinary pyrethroid metabolites is important to evaluate human exposure and potential for health effects.

    description: In 2012, an estimated 854 million pounds of conventional pesticides were used in the United States EPA, 2017. Chlorpyrifos was the insecticide used the most in the agricultural market sector with 4-8 million pounds applied. 2,4-D was the most used herbicide in the home and garden sector and second most used in the commercial sector, and it was the fourth most used herbicide in the agricultural sector. Pyrethroids were the most used insecticides in the home and garden sector. In 2012, the United States used 24 of all pesticides applied throughout the world. The widespread use of pesticides and the scientific interest in potential adverse health effects of pesticides exposure have increased the demand for fast and robust analytical methods for measuring biomarkers of pesticides.

    description: Neurofilaments are neuron-specific type IV intermediate filament heteropolymers composed of light, medium, and heavy chains Petzold, 2005. Neurofilaments are the dominant proteins of the neural cytoskeleton and are released into the extracellular space following neuro-axonal damage, and have thus been proposed as putative biomarkers of neuro-axonal injury in multiple neurological diseases Petzold, 2005 Lpinoux-Chambaud and Eyer, 2013 Bacioglu et al., 2016. Neurofilament light chain NfL especially, has been shown to be a promising biomarker because of its high solubility, and increased NfL levels have been found in the blood and CSF in several neurological disorders with underlying neuro-axonal degeneration, including multiple sclerosis MS, Alzheimers disease, Parkinsons disease, Huntingtons disease, motor neuron disease, stroke, inherited peripheral neuropathies, and traumatic brain injury Gunnarsson et al., 2011 Disanto et al., 2016 Weydt et al., 2016 Byrne et al., 2017 De Marchis et al., 2018 Olsson et al., 2019. Elevated concentrations of NfL have also been associated with disease severity in these patient populations, including in MS and other neurologic conditions Disanto et al., 2017 Preische et al., 2019. Importantly, serum neurofilament light chain sNfL has been shown to increase with age in healthy control cohorts however, age-specific reference ranges have not been well-defined Disanto et al., 2017. Taken together, higher sNfL values are observed in those with many neurological disorders however, sNfL levels among those without neurological disorders tend to increase with age.This data will characterize sNfL levels across the age distribution in a representative sample of non-institutionalized US adults.

    description: IntroductionIt has been proposed that racialethnic variation in prostate cancer incidence may be, in part, due to racialethnic variation in sex steroid hormone levels. However, it remains unclear whether in the US population circulating concentrations of sex steroid hormones vary by raceethnicity. To address this, concentrations of testosterone, sex hormone binding globulin, androstanediol glucuronide a metabolite of dihydrotestosterone and estradiol were measured in stored serum specimens from men selected for the 13 subsample where organochlorine pesticide levels were determined. This data file contains results of the testing of 1554 males age 12 or more years who were part of that sub sample and for whom serum was still available in the repository. Data Documentation for each of these four components is given in sections below.

    description: This data will allow for population estimates of the selected steriod hormones and related binding protein that can be used to assist in disease diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of disease such as, Polycystic Ovary Syndrome PCOS, androgen deficiency, cancer, and hormone imbalances in children. An estimated 5 to 7 million women in the United States U.S suffer with the effects of PCOS. It is the most common hormonal disorder among women of reproductive age, which can occur as young as 11 years old, and is the leading cause of infertility. Androgen deficiency such as hypogonadism is associated with a range of chronic diseases. The prevalence of symptomatic androgen deficiency in men between 30 and 79 years of age is estimated to be 5.6 Araujo et al, 2007. Androgen deficiency in men and excess in women and the associated chronic diseases are a public health concern. Estradiol is the key biomarker for assessing reproductive function in females, including amenorrhea, infertility, and menopausal status. Estradiol levels decline greatly with age, and this decrease is associated with increased risk for cardiovascular disease, cognitive impairment, and bone fractures in older populations. Estrogen hormone therapy, or use of estradiol as a supplement, raises health concerns related to estradiol concentration in blood such as elevated levels in postmenopausal women increasing the risk of breast cancer.

    description: Exclusion criteria were developed to prevent survey participants with specific health conditions from receiving certain MEC examination components for reasons of safety. In addition, criteria for exclusion were developed to address specific health conditions that would affect data collection or grading. Some exclusion criteria applied to more than one component. Therefore, a system of shared exclusion questions variable name prefix SEQ was developed so that a participant would only be asked about a condition one time. The information would be communicated or shared with multiple survey examination components.

  - name: spirometry_pre_and_post_bronchodilator_examination
    description: Spirometry, which means the measuring of breath, is a routinely used clinical pulmonary function test. It measures the amount and speed of air that a person can exhale after taking in the deepest possible breath. This allows estimates for lung volume and air flow rates to be made. Results from Spirometry testing are one key element among others needed to diagnose respiratory disorders, such as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease COPD. These diseases are typically characterized by a reduction in expiratory air flow rates. This is defined in spirometry as a reduction in the ratio of the expiratory volume measured in the 1st second of a forceful exhalation FEV1 to the total volume of air exhaled in a complete forced expiration FVC, the FVC being an estimate of the individuals effective lung volume. The Spirometric Measurements Section of the NHANES 2011-12 Respiratory Health Spirometry Procedures Manual contains a basic explanation of interpreting spirometry data.Spirometry is one of two NHANES 2011-12 components on respiratory health sponsored by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute of the National Institute of Health, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, National Center for Health Statistics and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health NIOSH. Individual Exhaled Nitrous Oxide ENO, a marker of airways inflammation, is also measured. The objective of the Spirometry data collection is to provide health examination data to estimate the current prevalence of asthma and COPD in the U.S. population. The data is also intended to help produce updated spirometric reference data for the U.S. population. National-level Spirometry data was collected in NHANES I 1971-1975, NHANES II 1976-1980, NHANES III 1988-1994 and most recently in NHANES 2007-10. Comparisons of the current data with that from previous studies will help to identify trends in respiratory conditions over time. Eligible participants performed an initial or baseline 1st test spirometry examination. Then a selected subsample of participants whose Baseline 1st Test Spirometry results showed a FEV1FVC ratio below the lower limit of normal andor below 70 were asked to repeat spirometry after inhaling a 2-adrenergic bronchodilator medication to open up their airways. This helps differentiate asthma from COPD Pellegrino, Viegi, Brusasco, et al. 2005. Asthma patients usually show improvements in post-bronchodilator spirometry testing, while patients with COPD exhibit little, if any, response to the medication. Spirometric testing using 2-adrenergic bronchodilator is routinely employed by clinicians to diagnose asthma in both children and adults, and current clinical practice guidelines NHLBI Expert Panel Report, 2007 consider post-bronchodilator spirometry testing is essential for the initial diagnosis of asthma. Second test post bronchodilator spirometry studies had not been performed in previous NHANES surveys.

    description: Although there has been a marked decrease in the number of primary and secondary syphilis cases in the United States, there has been very little decrease in the number of reported cases of late latent and tertiary syphilis over the past 20 years. This suggests that there may be a large pool of infected but asymptomatic persons. Although the primary and secondary stages of syphilis are infectious and associated with fetal wastage and the congenital syphilis syndrome, the tertiary stage is associated with a vasculitis that may cause neurologic and cardiovascular manifestations and other chronic problems. Similarly, primary and secondary syphilis increase the risk of HIV acquisition and transmission, while latent disease may be associated with the progression of HIV disease to AIDS and more prominent neurologic disease in HIV-infected persons. Despite the importance of syphilis as a risk factor for both chronic disease and the progression of HIV infection, there has not been a population-based measure of syphilis prevalence for the United States since 1980. Because these are often asymptomatic stages of infection and may lead to severe neurologic or cardiovascular complications, it is important to document a decrease in the late stages of syphilis that have resulted from our extraordinary efforts to reduce primary and secondary syphilis. NHANES offers a unique opportunity to estimate the prevalence of reactive serologic tests as an estimate of the prevalence of syphilis infections in the general population, to identify and confirm risk factors for syphilis, to confirm the risk for HIV infection and HIV-related neurologic disease among Americans with syphilis, and to monitor trends in prevalence as syphilis detection and treatment programs are established and expanded.

Most of the findings from the analyses of the blood samples are available immediately such as the data on cholesterol and triglyceride levels in the population. A small portion of the blood samples is stored to conduct later analyses on DNA samples. DNA provides important information on genetic or hereditary patterns of disease or risk of disease. This information leads to advances in the prevention and treatment of disease.

    description: Terpenes and their derivatives are common tropospherictrace gases Graedel, 1979. They are emitted by many species of vegetation andare best known as the group of compounds responsible for the pleasant anddistinctive odor of pine forests. Most vegetation emits an array of volatileorganic compounds VOCs Geron et. al., 2000. The major components ofconifer-derived VOCs are monoterpenes MTs, such as -pinene, -pinene,-myrcene, -3-carene, and limonene. Accordingto the documented physicochemical properties of MTs Falk A et. al., 1990 theyare sparingly soluble in water but are soluble in blood and lipophilic tissues.- and -Pinene dominate emissions from conifer trees and researchinvestigations have raised concerns regarding the physiological effect of-pinene on humans Nielsen et. al., 2005 Falk A.A. et. al., 1990. Exposureto high concentrations of -pinene 10450 mgm3 causes an increasein its concentration in the blood Falk A.A. et. al., 1990 and humanmetabolism of -pinene has also been documented Levin, 1996 Vanek et. al.,2005. Terpenes are also a major component of plantresins Paduch et. al., 2007. In plants they function as infochemicals,attractants, or repellents, as they are responsible for the typical fragranceof many plants Crowell, 1997 Theis et. al., 2003. In addition, terpenes areadded to e-cigarette fluids as flavor chemicals Tierney et. al., 2016.

Celiac disease is an intolerance to dietary glutens that has protean manifestations. In population surveys in other countries, it is found in about 0.5 to 1 percent of the population. Celiac disease may be as common in the United States, but it has not been adequately examined. Advances in diagnostic testing now allow accurate disease prevalence estimates using two step serological testing. To provide reliable population estimates, four to six years of data collection are required.

An estimated 5 to 7 million women in the United States U.S suffer with the effects of PCOS. It is the most common hormonal disorder among women of reproductive age, which can occur as young as 11 years old, and is the leading cause of infertility. The prevalence of symptomatic androgen deficiency in men between 30 and 79 years of age is estimated to be 5.6. This increases substantially with age, affecting approximately 4 to 5 million men in the U.S. The aging of the U.S. male population will cause a large increase in the burden of symptomatic androgen deficiency.

Serum ferritin was measured in NHANES 2001-2002 with a method that has now been shown to differ from the method needed to provide the appropriate ferritin values for use in the body iron model equation.

    description: Creatinine correction is the most commonly used method to compensate for variation in urine dilution when urinary biomarker is analyzed. However, in some case, Specific Gravity SG, or the combination of SG and creatinine was found to be more appropriate. In this study, the potential value of using SG, and both SG and creatinine will be investigated. The primary goal was to find if a correlation exists between uncorrected, creatinine-corrected, SG-corrected, and both creatinine- and SG-corrected urinary NNAL and serum cotinine, and which value showed the strongest correlation. Another goal was to determine the best method of correcting NNAL to account for variability in interpersonal urine concentrations in NHANES samples using creatinine and SG as normalizing factors both independently and simultaneously.

    description: The Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act of 2009 gave the Food and Drug Administration regulatory authority over tobacco products. In Section 907a, the Act states that the Secretary of HHS shall establish tobacco product standards. These product standards shall also include provisions for the testing of the tobacco products. In order to determine the effectiveness of these product standards, it is critical that surveillance systems be in place before the standards are enacted to determine whether they impact exposure of people who continue to use tobacco product. NHANES is an ideal source of human samples for assessing smokers in multiple locations around the country. NHANES will provide the most robust dataset possible for identifying changes in exposure of smokers that should result from enactment of tobacco product standards.

    description: The NHANES program suspended field operations in March 2020 due to the coronavirus disease 2019 COVID-19 pandemic. As a result, data collection for the NHANES 2019-2020 cycle was not completed and the collected data are not nationally representative. Therefore, data collected from 2019 to March 2020 were combined with data from the NHANES 2017-2018 cycle to form a nationally representative sample of NHANES 2017-March 2020 pre-pandemic data. These data are available to the public. Please refer to the Analytic Notes section for more details on the use of the data.

    description: Both the lab data and questionnaire items will be released in this file.Volatile Organic Compound QuestionsThe volatile organic compound section of the Mobile Examination Center MEC Interview and Phlebotomy Component PH provide personal interview data.Volatile Organic Compounds Whole BloodVolatile organic compounds VOCs are a large group of chemicals that have been used as solvents, degreasers, and cleaning agents in industry and consumer products. Many of the VOCs were found to contaminate ground water and drinking water sources, and because of human health concerns, have been banned or restricted from most uses.The halogenated solvents are VOCs consisting of a hydrocarbon chain or one hydrocarbon substituted with one or more chlorine or bromine atoms. Most of these chemicals are used as degreasers and solvents in various products such as paint. In the past, 1,1,1-trichloroethane was used as a dry cleaning agent, insect fumigant, and solvent in consumer products. Methylene chloride, perchloroethylene, and trichloroethene are other VOCs that were widely used in the past.Benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, xylene, and styrene, collectively referred to as BTEXS, are components of tobacco smoke and along with 2,5-dimethyl furan, these VOCs are usually detected in the blood of cigarette smokers at higher levels than in non-smokers. Chlorobenzene monochlorobenzene and the three dichlorobenzenes are halogenated aromatic hydrocarbons primarily used in industrial and chemical synthetic processes. Chlorobenzene has been used to produce DDT, phenol, and nitrobenzene. The dichlorobenzenes are also chemical intermediates in synthesis of dyes, pesticides, and other industrial products. 1,4-Dichlorobenzene para-dichlorobenzene is used also as a moth repellent and as a deodorizer. Disinfection by-products DBP, including bromodichloromethane, dibromochloromethane, bromoform, and chloroform are formed when chlorine interacts with natural organic materials found in water. Primary sources of DBPs are chlorinated drinking water and recreational water bodies, such as swimming pools.Inhalation is the most common VOC route of exposure in the general population, including indoor sources, such as paints, adhesives, cleaning solutions, and aerosolized insecticide sprays industries producing these solvents and contaminated waste disposal sites. Drinking water may contribute to exposure when underground drinking water supplies are contaminated. After they are absorbed in the body, VOCs are rapidly eliminated in exhaled breath, or may be rapidly metabolized and eliminated in the urine.
