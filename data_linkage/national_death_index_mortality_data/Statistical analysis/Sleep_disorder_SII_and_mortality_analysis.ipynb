    "Our studies found that high levels of SII were associated with a higher risk of total mortality  **[ HR (95% CI) = 1.15(1.07 - 1.22) ]**, and a marginally increased risk of CVD mortality **[ HR (95% CI) = 1.08(0.96 - 1.22) ]**, cancer mortality **[ HR (95% CI) = 0.97(0.86 - 1.10) ]**, and other causes of mortality  **[ HR (95% CI) =1.06(0.94 - 1.20)]**. For subjects with a high level of SII, the absence of a sleep disorder could attenuate **22%** risk of total mortality in the NHANES 1999–2012."
